//     paragraph1: 'Changing places during the game is important and you should definitely not fall in love with one position, but constantly walking around does the pictures a disservice. If you keep walking around the square and looking for a "better place", you will have a situation where you no longer control the background of your pictures. It would be better to choose a position for a while and then let the game and interesting moments come to you.',

This means that most games need to be viewed through the camera's viewfinder and to keep up with the camera's players and the movement of the ball.",

This media is stored in a safe place and is not removed too often. For this added security, it's a good idea to use old hard drives that have fallen out of the rotation of daily archive storage due to their small capacity.",

Since we were traveling with hand luggage, I decided to take the ultra-wide-angle Canon EF-S 10-18mm instead of my usual Canon EF 17-40mm for testing purposes. How well the lens, which was obtained from the aftermarket for 130 euros, did well, read the accompanying story.',

But next time, I'll take my 17-40mm lens with me again, even though it's about half as heavy and bigger. The main weight is the poorer colors of the ultra-wide angle and the visual distortion, which was more of a disadvantage when traveling",
